<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am The Flamingo Dancer, and I am learning web development to better understand algorithms, critical thinking, and observation, with the ultimate goal of mastering AI.</p>

<p>Why AI? Because it’s fascinating, endlessly evolving, and feels like the key to unlocking a whole new world of possibilities. I love the challenge of figuring out how things work and finding creative solutions to problems—whether that's coding a webpage or imagining how AI can make life better (and maybe a little cooler). I'm here for the journey, the "aha!" moments, and the chance to create something meaningful along the way. Let’s see where this adventure takes me!</p>
